# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my blog!  

I’m a self-taught programmer with a deep curiosity for how things work under the hood. Most of my time these days is spent on **Lumina**, my custom C++ game engine, a long-term project that combines my love for systems programming, graphics, and engine architecture.  

Before Lumina, I released several projects built with Unreal Engine, which you can find on Steam:  

- [The Other Side](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764750/The_Other_Side/)  
- [Just War Trains](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3154950/Just_War_Trains/)  
- [Egg Game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2517680/Egg_Game/)

## Beyond Development

Outside of programming, I’m a lifelong gamer inspired by the atmosphere and storytelling of classics like *Fallout 3* and *Fallout: New Vegas*. I’m also a huge fan of John Carpenter’s *The Thing* (1982), in my opinion, one of the finest horror films ever made.

## Why This Blog?

This blog is my place to share insights, techniques, and lessons learned, both the successes and the mistakes. Game engine development is an ongoing journey, and I want to document the process while hopefully helping others along the way.
