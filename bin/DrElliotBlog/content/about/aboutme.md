Hello, and welcome to my blog! I'm an Unreal Engine developer with a strong focus on networking and gameplay systems. With over three years of experience working in the engine, I've honed my skills in C++ and C, crafting efficient and scalable solutions for real-time multiplayer experiences.

Beyond development, I'm an avid gamer, deeply inspired by the intricate worlds and narratives of classics like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. These games have shaped my understanding of immersive gameplay and the importance of robust systems. When I'm not diving into code or exploring virtual wastelands, I enjoy revisiting timeless films like John Carpenter's The Thing (1982), a masterclass in tension and atmosphere.

Through this blog, I aim to share insights and techniques that can elevate your networking performance in C++ and help you tackle the challenges of game development with confidence.
