Hello, and welcome to my blog!

 I'm an Unreal Engine developer specializing in networking and gameplay systems. I've been working with the engine for just over two years, driven by a passion for expanding my knowledge.

Lately, I've been diving deep into advanced networking techniques, as well as on the Gameplay Ability System.

Outside of development, I'm a passionate gamer, inspired by the rich worlds and narratives of classics like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. I'm also a big fan of John Carpenter's The Thing (1982)â€”a true masterpiece in my eyes.

Through this blog, I hope to share the insights and techniques I've gathered along the way.

**As with any blog, please don't trust everything you read on the internet. Do you own tests, do your own confirmations.**
