# About Me

Hello, and welcome to my blog!  

I’m a self-taught programmer with a deep curiosity for how things work under the hood. Most of my time these days is spent on **Lumina**, my custom C++ game engine, a long-term project combining my love for systems programming, graphics, and engine architecture.

By day, I’m an airline pilot, though I prefer to keep that part of my life private. If you’d like to reach out or ask questions about programming or game development, feel free to connect on [Discord](https://discord.gg/UhTmzB8UdY).

I’ve also worked on *(or am currently part of)* several projects built with Unreal Engine, some of which you can find on Steam (in order of release):

- [**The Other Side**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2764750/The_Other_Side/) – no longer involved or supported  
- [**Just War Trains**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3154950/Just_War_Trains/) – may revive one day  
- [**Dead Signal**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2599300/Dead_Signal/) – contract work  
- [**Egg Game**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2517680/Egg_Game/) – an ancient piece of art  

**Unreleased / In Development:**

- [**Oddstone**](https://tinypotion.com/) – TBD  
- [**Unlucky Few**](https://www.google.com) – Zombie survival

Here, I post insights about Unreal Engine, programming in general, and occasionally share life lessons, reflections, and thoughts from my journey as a developer and hobbyist.

I previously owned and operated a game development studio, but due to disagreements, the studio is now closed. A confidential settlement agreement was reached by all parties involved.

## Beyond Development

Outside of programming, I’m a lifelong gamer, inspired by classics like *Fallout 3* and *Fallout: New Vegas*. I’m also a huge fan of John Carpenter’s *The Thing* (1982), which I consider one of the finest horror films ever made.  

I enjoy exploring storytelling, atmosphere, and design — whether in games, movies, or personal projects — and I often find inspiration in these experiences for my own work.

## Why This Blog?

This blog is my place to share insights, techniques, and lessons learned, both the successes and the mistakes. Game engine development is an ongoing journey, and I hope that by documenting it, I can help others navigate similar paths while keeping a record of my own growth.

Expect posts ranging from engine design deep dives and programming tips to personal reflections and the occasional story from my development adventures.

As with anything you read online, don’t take my word as gospel. Always test for yourself, verify results, and approach every piece of advice with curiosity and a critical mindset.
