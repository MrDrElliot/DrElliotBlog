# C++ Is Not Better Than Blueprint—They’re Just Different

---

You’ve probably heard the argument before: “C++ is better than Blueprint.” Often, this comes from people who are new to using C++ in Unreal Engine and are riding the peak of the Dunning-Kruger effect.

------------------------------------------------------------


The truth is, one isn’t better than the other—**they’re just different**. It’s like comparing a knife to a fork; they are different tools for different jobs. Claiming that C++ is superior to Blueprint, comes across as arrogant.

The reality is simple: use whatever you're comfortable with. Game development is hard—really hard. It becomes even more challenging when someone insists that Blueprint is inferior, urging you to drop everything and start following C++ tutorials. Use the tools that make you feel most at ease, and if you want to learn C++, go for it. But don’t do it because you think you’re missing out.


### Understanding the Differences

Yes, there are reasons to choose C++ over Blueprint for specific tasks, and it’s true that Blueprint is *marginally* slower than C++ in terms of execution time. But that’s what the profiler is for—use it to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks, and I cannot stress this enough.

As a newer developer, you’re unlikely to run into the limitations of Blueprint anytime soon, especially until you start diving into more advanced multiplayer features. When you do, you’ll naturally transition to using C++ where it’s necessary.

### Conclusion

In the end, it’s not about which tool is better—it’s about which tool is better for you, right now. Both C++ and Blueprint have their places in Unreal Engine development. They complement each other, providing flexibility and power depending on the needs of the project. So, focus on mastering the tool that makes you most productive, and remember: there’s no one-size-fits-all in game development.

When the time comes, you’ll know when to dive into C++. Until then, enjoy the journey, keep learning, and don’t let anyone else dictate the path you take.
