# Stop Being a Condescending Asshole in Programming Communities

We’ve all been there:  

**Q:** "Hey, I’m running into an issue with X, has anyone seen this before?"  
**A:** "Why would you even do that? That’s wrong."  

And just like that, a genuine question gets slapped down with arrogance instead of help.  

This happens constantly in programming Discords, and other communities. The attitude usually comes from the same place: ego. For some people, programming isn’t just problem-solving, it’s a stage for flexing intelligence at the expense of others.  

It’s toxic. It’s unnecessary. And it needs to stop.

## Why does this happen?

A few psychological and cultural factors fuel this behavior:  

1. **The Dunning-Kruger Effect**  
   Beginners who have just learned something often *overestimate* their grasp of it. Instead of saying, "I just figured this out too," they posture as if they’re experts. This easily morphs into dismissive answers.  
   - *Reference:* [Kruger & Dunning (1999), “Unskilled and unaware of it”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning–Kruger_effect)

2. **Confidence vs. Arrogance**  
   Explaining a concept clearly requires confidence. But when confidence turns into arrogance, answers start sounding like attacks. "That’s wrong" might feel efficient, but it’s really just lazy communication.

3. **Personality & Status Games**  
   Some programmers tie their self-worth to being "the smartest in the room." Answering with condescension becomes a way to establish dominance, not to solve the actual problem. **Online anonymity and lack of accountability only magnify this**.

## Why this matters

When you dismiss someone’s question with snark or superiority, here’s what you’re really doing:  

- **Shutting down curiosity.** The asker might think twice before engaging again.  
- **Weakening the community.** If newcomers get burned, they stop participating.  
- **Revealing insecurity.** Snide answers aren’t about knowledge; they’re about ego management.  

And honestly, let’s be real: *you aren’t special.* You aren’t inherently smarter than everyone else. No one’s impressed by how fast you can belittle someone online.

## How to actually answer a question

If you want to help without being an ass:  

1. **Ask for context.** Maybe the asker doesn’t have the same assumptions you do.  
2. **Explain why something doesn’t work.** Don’t just say "that’s wrong", show why.  
3. **Offer alternatives.** A better answer is: *"That approach won’t work because X. You might want to try Y instead."*  
4. **Check your tone.** Pretend you’re speaking to a coworker you don’t know well in real life. Would you phrase it the same way?

## Closing thought

Arrogance doesn’t make you look like an expert. It makes you look insecure.  

If someone is asking a question, it’s because they *don’t know*. That’s the whole point of communities, to share knowledge.  

So next time you feel the urge to say, "Why would you even do that?", stop. Take a breath. Answer like a human.  

Because at the end of the day, programming isn’t about proving who’s smartest. It’s about solving problems together.
