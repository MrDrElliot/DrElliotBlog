      <description>About Me Hello, and welcome to my blog!&#xA;I’m a self-taught programmer with a deep curiosity for how things work under the hood. Most of my time these days is spent on Lumina, my custom C++ game engine, a long-term project that combines my love for systems programming, graphics, and engine architecture.&#xA;Before Lumina, I released several projects built with Unreal Engine, which you can find on Steam:&#xA;The Other Side Just War Trains Egg Game Beyond Development Outside of programming, I’m a lifelong gamer inspired by the atmosphere and storytelling of classics like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.</description>
