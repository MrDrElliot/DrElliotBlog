      <description>Disclaimer: This post reflects general observations and lessons learned from working in creative industries.&#xA;It is not about any specific individual, project, or legal matter.&#xA;Starting a project with a friend can feel like the dream, shared vision, late-night brainstorming, the excitement of building something together. But money has a strange way of distorting relationships. When financial stakes enter the picture, priorities shift, values get tested, and even the strongest friendships can fracture.</description>

      <description>We’ve all been there:&#xA;Q: &amp;ldquo;Hey, I’m running into an issue with X, has anyone seen this before?&amp;rdquo;&#xA;A: &amp;ldquo;Why would you even do that? That’s wrong.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;And just like that, a genuine question gets slapped down with arrogance instead of help.&#xA;This happens constantly in programming Discords, and other communities. The attitude usually comes from the same place: ego. For some people, programming isn’t just problem-solving, it’s a stage for flexing intelligence at the expense of others.</description>

      <description>Inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that is deeply embedded in the design of Unreal Engine, and in many cases, it&amp;rsquo;s an elegant and powerful tool. However, like any tool, it can be overused, leading developers into a trap that can complicate development and maintenance in the long run.&#xA;The Trap of Overusing Inheritance Inheritance is often the go-to solution for sharing functionality across different classes. While it provides a straightforward way to extend and modify behavior, over-relying on it can lead to a rigid and tightly coupled codebase.</description>
